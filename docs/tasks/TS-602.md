# TS-602 — Operational Monthly Checklist Dashboard (Rules §17)

## Summary
Create a **monthly operations dashboard** that helps the Coordinator/Treasurer/Auditor reliably complete the **Rules §17 Monthly Checklist** and maintain an auditable record of completion.

This task is **operational UX + auditability**, not a replacement for the underlying workflows (Contributions, Draw, Payout, Statements).

## Rules coverage
- `rules.md` §17 (Monthly Checklist)
- `rules.md` §12 (records + transparency) via audit events for checklist actions
- `rules.md` §16 (privacy) — no exporting/sharing of sensitive info from this page by default

## Figma / Design
- Figma: **TBD** (use FigJam / light UI wireframe if needed).
- UX goals:
  - Show **current BillingMonth** prominently with a simple previous/next month selector.
  - Show **6 checklist steps** with clear status (done/not done), timestamp, and a “Go” link into the relevant feature.
  - Support states: loading, empty (no shomiti configured), success, error (DB failure).
  - Accessibility: tap targets, readable contrast, keyboard navigation (macOS).

## Primary screens
1) **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)**
   - Monthly progress (e.g., “3/6 done”)
   - Checklist items:
     1. Confirm attendance/proxies
     2. Confirm all payments received (or apply §9 policy)
     3. Run draw with witnesses
     4. Announce winner and payout amount
     5. Send payout and share proof
     6. Publish ledger + monthly statement
   - Each item row:
     - status toggle (complete/incomplete)
     - completion timestamp (if complete)
     - “Go” action: deep-links to the relevant page (Contributions/Draw/Payout/Statements/Ledger)

## Data & domain notes
- Persist checklist completion per `shomitiId` + `BillingMonth.key` + `itemKey`.
- Record every completion/uncompletion in **Audit log** (metadata only; no PII).

## Acceptance criteria
- Dashboard is no longer a placeholder; it shows the monthly checklist and navigation links.
- Checklist completion is persisted locally and survives app restarts.
- Checklist completion/uncompletion writes audit events.
- Widget tests cover: initial state, toggling an item, month navigation.
- Patrol test covers: open dashboard, complete an item, verify it remains completed after navigating away/back.
- E2E test covers: complete at least one item and verify the audit log contains the checklist audit event.

## Stage-specific notes
- Stage 2: UI only (fake data permitted, but should match final layout/keys).
- Stage 3: Real persistence + audit integration + Riverpod providers.
- Stage 4–6: add unit, Patrol, and E2E coverage.
