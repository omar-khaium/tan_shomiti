# TS-305 — Default Management + Enforcement Steps

**Goal:** Detect defaults (especially post-win risk) and record enforcement steps consistently and equally for all members.  
**Rules coverage (rules.md):** §9.3 (default definition + enforcement steps, no exceptions), §13 (disputes link), §12 (records transparency).  
**Depends on:** TS-203 (guarantor/deposit records), TS-302 (payments), TS-304 (short pot policy bookkeeping).  
**Out of scope:** disputes workflow UI (TS-504), payout workflows (TS-403), full statements (TS-501).

### Screen: Defaults dashboard

Shows a list of members with:
- `status`: `Clear` / `At risk` / `In default`
- `missedCount`: number of missed payments (per policy thresholds)
- `nextStep`: enforcement step to take next (Reminder → Notice → Guarantor/Deposit → Dispute)

Actions:
- `Record reminder` (logs audit + enforcement record)
- `Record written notice` (logs audit + enforcement record)
- `Apply guarantor / deposit` (logs audit + ledger entry)
- `Open dispute` (placeholder link to TS-504)

### Required keys (for tests)
- `defaults_row_<position>`
- `defaults_status_<position>`
- `defaults_record_reminder_<position>`
- `defaults_record_notice_<position>`
- `defaults_apply_guarantor_<position>`

## Acceptance criteria
- Default thresholds are enforced from persisted payment history.
- Enforcement steps are recorded in order and are append-only.
- Audit events are appended for every step (no organizer exceptions).
