# TS-501 — Ledger View + Monthly Statement Generation

**Goal:** Provide transparent ledger access and generate an auditable monthly statement after payout.  
**Rules coverage (rules.md):** §12 (records & transparency), §17 (operational monthly checklist).  
**Depends on:** TS-403 (payout proof), TS-401/TS-402 (draw + finalize), TS-301/TS-302 (dues + payments), TS-003 (audit/ledger).

## Stage 1 (Figma)

> Figma URLs pending. Until a Figma file is provided, this spec acts as the UI contract for Stage 2.

### Screen A — Statements (month selector + generate)

Purpose:
- Let users select a month and generate/view the statement for that month.
- Make it obvious what data is included and what is missing (no surprises).

Content:
- Month header (prev/next)
- Status:
  - “Not ready” if payout not marked paid (TS-403)
  - “Ready” if payout marked paid + proof recorded
- Primary action:
  - “Generate statement” (enabled only when ready)
- Secondary:
  - “View ledger” link (optional; ledger already exists)

Required keys (for tests):
- `statement_month_label`
- `statement_generate`
- `statement_ready_badge`

### Screen B — Statement detail (read-only)

Purpose:
- Provide a verifiable monthly snapshot that members can review.

Sections (read-only):
- Collection summary:
  - Total due
  - Total collected
  - Covered amount (if any)
  - Shortfall (must be 0 for payout months)
- Draw summary:
  - Winner member + share index
  - Draw proof reference
  - Witness count + finalized timestamp
- Payout summary:
  - Amount paid
  - Payout proof reference
  - Paid timestamp

Required keys:
- `statement_total_due`
- `statement_total_collected`
- `statement_shortfall`
- `statement_winner_label`
- `statement_draw_proof`
- `statement_payout_proof`

## Acceptance criteria
- Statement cannot be generated unless payout is marked paid (proof required).
- All statement generation/view actions are audit logged.
- Statement is derived from persisted records (not recomputed “from UI state”).
- Statement is read-only; sign-off is handled in TS-502.
